Description: Expedites analysis of circadian period results found in
    imp_detrended_results files produced by MetaMorph per the workflow recommended
    by Cassandra Baker (Harmer Lab, Integrative Genetics and Genomics Graduate 
    Group, UC Davis) for analyzing luciferase reporter assays performed on A. 
    thaliana. It implements basic data wrangling and graphing functions to 
    organize data and create plots, facilitating rapid comparison of circadian 
    period data between different families or organisms. Some functions may be 
    generalizable to other organisms for which similar data are available.
